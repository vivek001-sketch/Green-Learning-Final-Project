## 🚀 Project Overview

### 🌍 Air Quality Prediction (24 Hours Ahead)  

Air pollution poses serious risks to **health, climate, and the environment**.  
This project aims to **predict the Air Quality Index (AQI) for the next 24 hours**, helping in **early warnings, pollution control, and sustainable urban planning**.  

Key goals:  
- Preprocess and clean the air quality dataset  
- Train ML models for **AQI forecasting (24 hours ahead)**  
- Classify air quality into standard categories (*Good, Moderate, Unhealthy, Very Unhealthy, Hazardous*)  
- Provide **visual insights** for monitoring and decision-making

## 🧠 Machine Learning Approach

- **Problem Type**: Time-Series Forecasting + Classification  
- **Algorithms Used**: Random Forest Regressor, Logistic Regression, AutoML models  
- **Features**:  
  - PM2.5, PM10  
  - NO₂, SO₂, CO, O₃  
  - Temperature, Humidity, Wind speed, Pressure  
- **Target**:  
  - AQI after 24 hours  
  - AQI Category (Good / Moderate / Unhealthy / Hazardous)

## 📂 Dataset

The dataset (`Air_Quality_Project_110_Rows.csv`) contains **110 rows of air quality data** with meteorological and pollutant parameters.  

**Sample Format**:  

| PM2.5 | PM10 | NO₂ | SO₂ | CO | O₃ | Temp | Humidity | AQI | AQI_after_24h |
|-------|------|-----|-----|----|----|------|----------|-----|---------------|
| 54.0  | 82.0 | 34  | 20  | 0.8| 45 | 29.5 | 68       | 122 | 118           |
| 40.5  | 75.0 | 28  | 15  | 0.6| 50 | 27.1 | 70       | 97  | 104           |

- **AQI** → Current air quality index  
- **AQI_after_24h** → Predicted AQI after 24 hours
